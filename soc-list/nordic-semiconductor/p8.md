# P8
The P8 smartwatch is very similar in hardware to the PineTime.

## General Information
Due to the shared hardware between this watch and the PineTime, a lot of the information on [the PineTime wiki](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PineTime) can be used for P8 development.
### Touch Panel
There are two versions of the P8 with different touch panels. One version has the Hynitron CST816S touch controller, with the other having the CST716S.  

To see which version you have on the stock firmware, you can look at the _about_ page. There will be a string that looks like `00 B4 00 02`. Ending in `01` means you have the CST816S, and ending in `02` means you have the CST716S. Alternatively, swipe behaviour can determine which you have. If you swipe and keep your finger on the display, the CST716 will not register the swipe until after your finger has been removed, whereas the CST816S will register the swipe before your finger has been removed.  

The CST716S also has a slightly different display, which exhibits temporary burn-in in some circumstances.  

The CST816S is more desirable because it has the ability to wake from a sleeping state (where its current draw will be negligible). The CST716S cannot wake from this state and so to have tap-to-wake behaviour, you must settle with a ~3mA current draw in keeping the controller in a standby state.

So far PineTime devkits have only shipped with the CST816S.

## Development Efforts
### [ATCwatch / Arduino](https://github.com/atc1441/ATCwatch) 
- Written by [Aaron Christophel](https://github.com/atc1441/)
- Uses LVGL for graphics
- Can be compiled for both P8 and PineTime (select version in pinout header)
- Getting the Arduino IDE working on Windows is as simple as downloading and extracting the rar from [here](https://atcnetz.de/downloads/D6Arduino.rar)
  - For Linux, the tutorial [here](https://github.com/0x416c6578/ATCwatch/blob/master/linux-tutorial.md) can be followed
- Having an Arduino build environment allows you to develop for both the PineTime and P8, and you can take advantage of nicer editors like VSCode

### [p8-firmware](https://github.com/0x416c6578/p8-firmware)
- An Arduino based firmware based off ATCwatch
- More useful as a documentation resource to see how ATCwatch works, since a lot of the code is reused and explained

### PineTime Development
- Since the hardware is shared with the PineTime, a lot of the development effort put into that device can be used for the P8
- See [the PineTime wiki](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PineTime) for more information

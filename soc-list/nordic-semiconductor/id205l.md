## General Information
The watch is not re-flashable without taking it apart as the bootloader uses a signing key that is not available.

There are 2 methods to open and re-flash it.

-1. Like in kvasdopil's repo described by taking apart the frame and then the front glass.

-2. Drilling a small hole at the exact point where the SWD port is and putting acupuncture needles inside to CLK and SWD.

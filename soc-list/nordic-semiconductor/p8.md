## General Information
### Touch Panel
There are two versions of the P8 with different touch panels. One version has the Hynitron CST816S touch controller, with the other having the CST716S.  

To see which version you have on the stock firmware, you can look at the _about_ page. There will be a string that looks like `00 B4 00 02`. Ending in `01` means you have the CST816S, and ending in `02` means you have the CST716S. Alternatively, swipe behaviour can determine which you have. If you swipe and keep your finger on the display, the CST716 will not register the swipe until after your finger has been removed, whereas the CST816S will register the swipe before your finger has been removed.  

The CST716S also has a slightly different display, which exhibits temporary burn-in in some circumstances.  

The CST816S is more desirable because it has the ability to wake from a sleeping state (where its current draw will be negligible). The CST716S cannot wake from this state and so to have tap-to-wake behaviour, you must settle with a ~3mA current draw in keeping the controller in a standby state.
